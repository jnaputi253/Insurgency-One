# The Goal

I'm a firm believer that technology is not just some 9 to 5 gig.  Technology is something that allows us to enrich and
better ourselves because of the opportunity to learn something new each and every day.  The goal of these Insurgencies
is to develop a project using technologies that I either:

* Don't have a lot experience with; or,
* Have not dealt with as-of-yet

The ultimate goal of these Insurgencies is to learn and have fun.  The end result doesn't have to be world changing.

And with that, let is kick off the first Insurgency!

# The Stack

The stack for this project is the following:

* React
* TypeScript
* C#
* Amazon Web Service

# Why These?

Although I am quite comfortable in C# and React, I would like to incorporate TypeScript into the mix so I can get a better understanding of it.  I've had a fascination with cloud technologies but haven't really dived into them that much.  This Insurgency will allow me to have a better understanding of AWS.
